Mercury: Recommendation Engine Sandbox Using Movielens Dataset
=====================

This is a sandbox system for recommendation engine using the 100K MovieLens Dataset.

It implement the classics recommendation algorithm,such as:

(1) User Based Collaborative Filtering; 
(2) Item Based Collaborative Filtering;
(3) Personal Content Based Recommendation Algorithm;
(4) FunkSVD,BiasSVD.

I use several methods to improve the effectiveness of User Based Collaborative Filtering:

(1) Clustering the items using Kmeans and EM;
(2) Using different similarity calculation method,such as Cosine,Pearson Correlation Similarity,Euclidean distance;
(3) Using matrix dimensionality reduction method such as PCA/ICA; 

I am adding more and more algorithm and optimization.
